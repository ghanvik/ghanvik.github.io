Below is an email I copywrote to be sent out to about 200 software engineering candidates per week.

Hi [candidate name],

I was really impressed with your Software Engineering experience and wanted to share some exciting opportunities you might find interesting. Weâ€™re looking for talented software engineers like yourself to build features for Amazon Alexa. We have roles all across North America (some **100% remote**).

Alexa Social, a brand new organization, builds features that connect people from across the globe through shared experiences. Alexa Social currently supports features like photo and video sharing. We are growing rapidly, and making strategic investments in multiple new social experiences like building a social feed. This is a new organization where you will get the **opportunity to build brand new features** from the ground up!

If this sounds exciting to you, please let me know so we can set up a quick call to figure out if Alexa is right for you.

Best,
Vikram
