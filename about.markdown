My name is Vikram Ghangurde and I am a prospective technical writer. I graduated from the University of British Columbia with a BA in History and a minor in International Relations in November of 2021. UBC helped me build a foundation in writing and editing. Since then, I have participated in the open-source LibreOffice documentation community as well as work on my own personal projects to bolster my technical knowledge. This website showcases some of my best work and shares what I've learned along the way.

This website was created using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub.
