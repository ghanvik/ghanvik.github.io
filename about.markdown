My name is Vikram Ghangurde and I am a prospective technical writer. I graduated from the University of British Columbia with a BA in History and a minor in International Relations in November of 2021. My degree built a strong foundation in writing and editing. Since then, I have participated in the open-source LibreOffice documentation community and the Support Mozilla community to bolster my technical writing experience. This website showcases my work and shares what I've learned along the way.

I'm located in the Seattle area. In my free time, I love to cook, bake, and read sci-fi and fantasy novels.

This website was created using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub.
